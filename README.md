# Discord-EpicSeven-Activity
This script will set a custom discord rich activity arround the world of Epic Seven.

## Requirements:
This requires EasyRP from https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP
I will also include one in download so don't worry.

Now you can choose to download just the executable E7-Presence, the pack that contains both, EasyRP and the E7-Presence.
Or download the project, modify and compile on your own.

## The process:
This script is built arround Easy-RP, it's the core that makes the pressence possible.
I plan to improve the current build to not depend on other projects, and might break the code in smaller pieces for better work.

## Get the app running
1. Make sure E7-Presence.exe is in the same folder with EasyRP.exe.
2. Run E7-Presence.exe to start updating the config.ini file.
3. Run EasyRP.exe, it will detect the changes in config.ini and update the discord pressence automatically.


This is the first working build, i will work further on the project to improve it.
Things that i plan to do:
1. Optimize the code and break into multiple pices/files
2. Remove EasyRP dependency
3. Add a pannel where user can "toggle" on two modes:
           - auto (randomized)
           - manual (pick activity on your own)
      things to consider: maybe add a queue where users can make theyr own custom path and save it.
4. Add support for Side Story (currently the present side story is hardcoded)
      I have to update the code manually and rebuild everytime the side story changes.
